# Minesweeper

This is a simple browser-based implementation of the classic **Minesweeper** game. The player tries to clear a grid without detonating hidden mines.

## Features

- Click on tiles to reveal empty spaces or mines.
- Use a flagging mode to mark suspected mines.
- Win the game by clearing all non-mined tiles.
- Lose the game by clicking on a mined tile.

## How to Play

1. **Left-click** on any tile to reveal what's underneath:
   - If it's a number, it shows how many mines are adjacent to that tile.
   - If it's an empty space, the adjacent tiles are automatically revealed.
   - If it's a mine, you lose the game.
2. **Flag mode**: To mark a tile that you think has a mine, toggle the flag mode by clicking the ðŸš© button, then click on the tile to place a flag. Clicking again removes the flag.
3. The game ends when all non-mined tiles are revealed, or when you click on a mine.
